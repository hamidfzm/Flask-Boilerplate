# Flask-Boilerplate
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

After years of web development with flask I decided to share my experience in flask applications structure.
Since I couldn't find any good boilerplate that could satisfy my needs when I start new projects.

I happily appreciate your suggestions and pull requests in order to improve this boilerplate.

## Configure
In order to setup virtual environment and dependency manager for this project run configure for first type.

```console
foo@bar:Flask-Boilerplate$ ./configure.sh 
foo
```
